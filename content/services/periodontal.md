Healthy gums are the foundation of a healthy smile. Our comprehensive periodontal services help prevent, diagnose, and treat gum disease.

## Periodontal Disease Overview

Periodontal disease affects the gums and bone supporting your teeth. Left untreated, it can lead to tooth loss and has been linked to systemic health issues including heart disease and diabetes.

## Advanced Periodontal Therapy

Specialized treatment for moderate to severe gum disease, focusing on eliminating infection and restoring gum health.

## Scaling and Root Planing / Deep Cleaning

A thorough cleaning procedure that removes plaque and tartar from below the gum line and smooths root surfaces to promote healing.

## Site Delivery of Antibiotics

Localized antibiotic therapy placed directly into periodontal pockets to eliminate bacteria and promote healing.

## Periodontal Maintenance

Regular maintenance cleanings (typically every 3-4 months) to prevent recurrence of periodontal disease and maintain gum health.

## Signs of Periodontal Disease

- Bleeding gums when brushing or flossing
- Red, swollen, or tender gums
- Persistent bad breath
- Receding gums
- Loose teeth
- Changes in bite alignment

Early detection and treatment are key to preserving your natural teeth and maintaining overall oral health.
