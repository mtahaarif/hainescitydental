## White Fillings / White Tooth Color Bonding

White (tooth colored) filling or bonding is used to repair a tooth that is affected by decay, cracks, fractures, etc. The decayed or affected portion of the tooth will be removed and then filled with a composite filling.

Because the white fillings are tooth colored, they can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth, and are more aesthetically suited for use in front teeth or the more visible areas of the mouth. This procedure is commonly performed to mend chips, cracks, discolorations, or misarranged teeth. It also is an alternative to veneers.

This is a beautiful restoration that can be completed in a single office visit and can improve the overall look of a tooth tremendously. The longevity of this restoration is 3-5 years. These restorations can stain, wear, and chip as its strength is not the same as natural enamel.

## Porcelain Crowns / Caps

A crown (or cap) is a covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size. A crown protects and strengthens tooth structure that cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations. They are highly durable and will last many years with proper care.

**Reasons for crowns:**
- Broken or fractured teeth
- Cosmetic enhancement
- Decayed teeth  
- Fractured fillings
- Large fillings
- Tooth has a root canal

**What does getting a crown involve?**

A crown procedure usually requires two appointments. Your first appointment will include taking several highly accurate molds (or impressions) that will be used to create your custom crown. A mold will also be used to create a temporary crown which will stay on your tooth for approximately two weeks until your new crown is fabricated by a dental laboratory.

While the tooth is numb, the dentist will prepare the tooth by removing any decay and shaping the surface to properly fit the crown. At your second appointment your temporary crown will be removed, the tooth will be cleaned, and your new crown will be carefully placed to ensure the spacing and bite are accurate.

## Porcelain Veneers

Porcelain veneers are thin shells of ceramic that bond directly to the front surfaces of the teeth. They are a great choice for improving your smile especially for teeth that have gaps, heavy stains, irregular shape or size. Veneers are a very conservative approach to creating a beautiful smile. They are very natural appearing and highly resistant to coffee and even cigarette stains.

**Will they look like normal teeth?**

When bonded to the teeth, the ultra-thin porcelain veneers are virtually undetectable and highly resistant to coffee, tea, or even cigarette stains. For strength and appearance, their resemblance to healthy, white tooth enamel is unsurpassed by other restorative options.

**How durable are porcelain veneers?**

With proper care, porcelain veneers will brighten your smile for well over a decade. Our doctors will ensure that your veneers are crafted from the highest quality porcelains and are bonded with the most advanced and proven materials available.
