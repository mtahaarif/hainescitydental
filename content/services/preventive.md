One of the simplest dental hygiene exercises you can do for yourself is something you've heard before and it bears repeating: brush and floss regularly!

## Regular Cleaning / Prophylaxis

Professional teeth cleaning to remove plaque, tartar, and surface stains. Recommended every six months for optimal oral health.

## Periodontal Maintenance

Specialized cleanings for patients with a history of gum disease, typically performed every 3-4 months to prevent recurrence.

## Advanced Periodontal Therapy

Comprehensive treatment for active periodontal disease, including deep cleaning and ongoing maintenance.

## Dental Examinations

Comprehensive oral health evaluations including:
- Visual examination of teeth and gums
- Oral cancer screening
- Digital x-rays when necessary
- Bite analysis
- TMJ assessment

## Fluoride Treatments

Strengthening treatments that help prevent tooth decay and can reverse early signs of cavity formation.

## Sealants

Protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth to prevent cavities, especially beneficial for children and teens.

## Patient Education

We believe informed patients make better decisions about their oral health. Our team takes time to:
- Demonstrate proper brushing and flossing techniques
- Explain treatment options and preventive strategies
- Answer all your questions about oral health
- Provide customized home care recommendations

Prevention is always better than treatment. Regular dental visits help us catch problems early when they're easier and less expensive to treat.
